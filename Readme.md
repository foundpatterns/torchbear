## Contributions wanted

Torchbear extends Rust's burgeoning ecosystem of libraries. Developers are welcomed to [make small changes](https://github.com/foundpatterns/torchbear/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asize%2F0.25) as well as high impact contributions, like [adding bindings](https://github.com/foundpatterns/torchbear/labels/feature%2Fbindings).  There are many examples to learn from in the bindings directory, each with an interesting history.  You'll learn a Rust library's API inside and out, and you'll put another tool into the hands of a growing userbase.
