## Installation

Torchbear comes as a single executable, making it very easy to install.  The latest version is available on [Torchbear's GitHub releases page](https://github.com/foundpatterns/torchbear/releases), so you can download the zip file for your operating system and hardware architecture from there and unzip the executable wherever is most convenient for you.  To make it simpler, you can use our install script by copying and pasting this line into your terminal, then just running `torchbear` or `torchbear.exe` in any of your apps:

```sh
 curl https://git.io/fpcV6 -sSfL | sh
 ```

#### How to add a terminal on non-linux environments

(If you haven't heard of a terminal before, here's a [1 min intro to what is a terminal window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw).)

Windows: install [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) Full.

Android users, install [Termux](https://termux.com/).

MacOS comes ready, but [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) has many additional tools.

## Examples

#### Hello World App

- in `init.lua`

`print("hello from Torchbear")`

- in `Settings.toml`

`init = "init.lua"`

- run `torchbear`

#### [Torchbear Static Webserver](https://github.com/foundpatterns/torchbear-static-webserver)

#### [Lighttouch Application Framework](https://github.com/foundpatterns/lighttouch) (üëçüëç for Web Development!)

## Contributions wanted

Torchbear extends Rust's burgeoning ecosystem of libraries. Developers are welcomed to [make small changes](https://github.com/foundpatterns/torchbear/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asize%2F0.25) as well as high impact contributions, like [adding bindings](https://github.com/foundpatterns/torchbear/labels/feature%2Fbindings).  There are many examples to learn from in the bindings directory, each with an interesting history.  You'll learn a Rust library's API inside and out, and you'll put another tool into the hands of a growing userbase.
